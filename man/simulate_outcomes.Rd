\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame including treatment assignment (\code{ARM} or \code{ARMCD}).}

\item{arm_col}{Character; name of the treatment column (default = "ARM").}

\item{outcome_type}{Type of outcome: "continuous", "binary", or "ordinal".}

\item{effect_size}{Numeric; effect size (difference in means or odds ratio).}

\item{baseline_mean}{Mean outcome in control group (for continuous).}

\item{baseline_sd}{Standard deviation in control group (for continuous).}

\item{prob_baseline}{Probability of success in control group (for binary).}

\item{n_levels}{Integer; number of levels for ordinal outcome.}

\item{covariates}{Optional character vector of covariate names to include as predictors.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer for reproducibility.}

\item{param}{Character; label of the outcome (e.g. "Change in BP").}
}
\value{
Data frame with added columns: \code{AVAL}, \code{AVALC}, \code{PARAM}, \code{PARAMCD}.
}
\description{
Simulates patient-level outcomes (continuous, binary, or ordinal) based on treatment assignment
and specified treatment effect. Optionally includes covariate-based variation and generates
ADaM-like variables (\code{AVAL}, \code{AVALC}, \code{PARAM}, \code{PARAMCD}).
