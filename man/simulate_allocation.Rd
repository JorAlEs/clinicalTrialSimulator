\title{Randomly allocate patients to treatment arms}
\usage{
simulate_allocation(
  data,
  arm_names = c("Control", "Treatment"),
  ratio = c(1, 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of patients (e.g., output of \code{\link{simulate_patients}}).}

\item{arm_names}{Character vector of arm names. Default is c("Control","Treatment") for a two-arm trial.}

\item{ratio}{Numeric vector of allocation ratios for each arm (same length as \code{arm_names}). Default is c(1,1) for equal allocation.}
}
\value{
The input data frame with an added factor column \code{Arm} indicating the treatment group for each patient.
}
\description{
This function assigns each patient to a treatment arm (e.g., control or treatment) according to specified allocation ratios.
}
\details{
Allocation is done by simple random sampling. The \code{ratio} vector is normalized to probabilities. If an arm receives no patients by chance (especially when sample size is small), the \code{Arm} factor will still include that level (to preserve all arm levels).
}
\examples{
df <- simulate_patients(10)
# Allocate patients equally to "Placebo" vs "Drug" arms
df <- simulate_allocation(df, arm_names = c("Placebo","Drug"), ratio = c(1,1))
table(df$Arm)

}
